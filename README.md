 Credit Card Approval Analysis

Welcome to my very first data analysis project! 🎉  
In this notebook, I explore and prepare a real-world credit card dataset for machine learning.  
The goal is to understand customer behavior and build a foundation for predicting whether a customer will be approved for a credit card.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project includes:
- ✅ Loading and merging datasets
- ✅ Handling missing values and data cleaning
- ✅ Feature engineering (e.g., Age, Years Employed)
- ✅ Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations
- ✅ Data preparation for machine learning

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool        | Purpose                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Python      | Core programming language   |
| Pandas      | Data manipulation           |
| NumPy       | Numerical operations        |
| Matplotlib  | Basic plotting              |
| Seaborn     | Advanced visualizations     |
| Scikit-learn| ML model prep and training  |

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Gender vs Income Type Distribution
- Education vs Income Type
- Ownership (Car/Property) Distribution
- Family Members, Housing, Marital Status
- Correlation Heatmap
- Years Employed and Age Histograms

## 🚀 Next Steps

- 🧠 Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree)
- 📈 Evaluate model performance
- 🧪 Try hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- 🌐 Deploy as a small app using Streamlit

 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm currently learning to become a Data Scientist and Analyst. This is my first GitHub project, and more will follow as I continue growing. I'm open to feedback and suggestions!
